This library provides a simple replacement of the "readline" functionality.

Forked from: https://github.com/philipc/tinyrl

Twicked tinyrl a bit to use it over telnet.

You will find 2 examples, both uses tinyrl to implement a Command Line Interpreter (CLI):
	* one on a local terminal (cli_prompt.c)
	* the other over telnet (cli_telnet.c)

Hope you find it as useful as it is to me.

Is there something wrong with the code? Is the license not ok? 
Just let me know and I will look into it.
